## Overview

Welcome to the Olive Garden Fanpage Project! Our mission is to develop a comprehensive full-stack fanpage for Olive Garden, using the latest technologies like Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind. Our goal is to create an engaging and feature-rich web application that embodies the essence of the Olive Garden brand.

## Challenges and Collaboration

Leading this ongoing project presented several significant challenges, particularly in managing a small team and coordinating all project phases. The responsibility of daily standups, code reviews, and task allocation required effective communication and project management skills. Ensuring that team members felt supported with clear goals was a constant challenge that demanded continuous attention and adaptability. Thorough planning was crucial, from creating the overall project steps to crafting detailed Figma specifications, setting up development environments, and creating structured issue lists with relevant tasks and branches.

## Custom API

A key aspect of this project involves creating a custom API from scratch, featuring hand-crafted endpoints tailored to deliver data and facilitate seamless front-end functionality.

## Authentication

Additionally, we've implemented robust authentication mechanisms using Firebase to securely manage and track user data. These measures provide a personalized and secure experience for users of the Olive Garden fanpage.

## Technical Challenges

An ongoing project of this nature inevitably encountered technical challenges that required my direct involvement. Handling the more complex aspects of the code and stepping in for bug fixing and polishing were regular tasks. I provided assistance and guidance to team members as needed, particularly when they requested help or submitted pull requests. Maintaining a clear vision and timeline for project milestones was another challenge that demanded constant monitoring and adjustment.
